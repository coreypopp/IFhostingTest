Other than this README.TXT, the primary files for this website are generated using Inform 7 "Release along with an interpreter" and copied from the local Release folder to the Github repository. The interpreter subfolder is automatically generated and is required for the game to run in a web browser. 

The SOURCE subfolder is manually created and contains the most recent source code. 
The FEELIES subfolder is manually created and contains all of the game's feelies.
